Design concept : 

A mobile application striving to foster children's natural sense of curiosity and encourage engagement with the environment.
 # Children 
Children can select their topics of interest and recieve daily quests to find and take a picture of something related to the topic, 
making exploring the world around them fun and rewarding. 

Regardless of success in finding their challenge item, kids then recieve a fun learning module to better understand what they found.
The app intends to reinforce a love for curiosity by not punishing failure to find an item, chosing to reinforce positive failure instead.

The topic ends with a spotlight feature on an underrepresented researcher in the related field, to explore the history of research in an
honest light and inspire children of all walks of life with role models. 

Kids can keep 'streaks' of how many days in a row they've done a quest, and compare with their friends!

# Parents
Parents can see their children's progress in various STEM topics, and track their child's location with a ping if their kid strays too
far during their quest as a safety feature.
